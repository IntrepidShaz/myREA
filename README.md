# myREA

The idea of this project is to create a Remote Executive Assistant that will eventually
> Manage my expenses and give a nice graphical view of where I'm spending
> Manage my meetings, pending work and ToDos
> Store checklists that will simplify life - for example checklists to help pack for a trip, hand the vehicle over for service, etc
> Track miscellaneous stuff such as vehicle fuel consumption, time spent on connecting with people etc
> Save good links that can be brought up when needed - like delicious (https://del.icio.us)

Why everything?

> I like GnuCash. But it does not do everything I want it to do. And I want an income/expense tracking tool that is online, instead of staying put on my desktop.
> Any.Do is good. I use it. But I I need something where I am able to evaluate the outcomes of my tasks and visualize if I'm moving towards my goals. I want my tasks to link up to my goals. I nee a tool where I can set goals and add tasks that will help me get to my goal. If I'm doing too many tasks that are not relevant to my goal, I need to see my other tasks.
> Have used Google keep and a few other checklist apps. But I want to create checklists as templates and have instances of the checklists that I can use in my life.
> I am bad at connecting with people. I don't call on people often and many a times, even forget to call back. Communication is the lifeline of any relationship. And I need to know how I'm doing at that. I need a sorted list based on talk time. (Whatsapp and msgs do not count unless it is a whatsapp call and I want to be able to tell that I talked to the person for X mins)
> I want to know the best fuel pump, the time of day when I need to fill fuel for the best mileage etc. I need fuel management to be smarter.
> My bookmarks are a mess. Even in office. Need a system that will help me add more descriptions/tags so I can retrieve the bookmarks and not have to search for them.
